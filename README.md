# Store Management 

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

For my solo project, I want to build an app that would help and make it easy for shop owners to track how much customers owe â€”both overdue and not, what items they have purchased and date of transactions.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
